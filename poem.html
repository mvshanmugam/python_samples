    <b> My Summer 2020 </b> <br>
    <i>
      A day has gone by, but nobody notices ever... <br>
      these are much hard times! <br>
      The 'crown' disease has taken over our summer... <br>
      I do not know why, at times! <br>
      <br>
      I hope and I hope... that this will soon be over, <br>
      But, I'm losing hope! <br>
      When this has gone by, <br>
      What will happen I wonder... after Covid-19? <br>
      <br>
      Will happier times come again?! <br>
      Or will we all still be stuck inside? <br>
      As the virus stops spreading, <br>
      I look past... at the year 2020. <br>
      <br>
      Be kind!  Not cruel...  to others and to nature! <br>
      Or else, things of such nature <br>
      may come haunt us as second nature!! <br>
